Probability is fundamental to statistical practice.

Understanding probability is key to understanding statistical models and how to fit and interpret them.

\begin{frame}{I think that:}

\begin{Large}
\begin{itemize}
\item Probability is fundamental to statistical practice.
\item However, the important part is understanding probability as a tool for expressing uncertainty...
\item ...while the calculus and algebra of mathematical manipulations are practically almost irrelevant.
\item Practitioners of statistics are too often scared away by the mathematics of probability.
\end{itemize}
\end{Large}

\begin{frame}{Probabilistic thinking}

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1.2em

\item The main task of statistics (and life) is making decisions in the presence of uncertainty.

\item Probability is a formal language for describing uncertainty.

\item Probability is not that complicated - it's actually quite natural and the bare minimum we need to understand eachother.

\item Probability distributions are like words - the more you know, the more expressive you can be.

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Important observations}

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1.2em

\item Uncertainty is part of everyday life...

\item ... we've even developed natural language to express it!

\item However, natural language is imprecise, incoherent and lacks expressiveness...

\item which makes it useless for serious quantitative work.

\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Conclusion: \textbf{We need to agree on a more formal language for expressing uncertainty!}

\begin{frame}{Formal definition of probability}

\begin{scriptsize}


\bigskip

Set of outcomes \textbf{$\Omega$} (set of all possible truths).

\smallskip

Set of events \textbf{$S$}  (all sets that we will assign probability to\footnote{The formalism used here is a $\sigma-$algebra.}).

\bigskip

A probability function $P$ a function $P:S \rightarrow [0,1]$ that satisfies the axioms of probability:

\begin{description}
\item[A1] $P(A) \geq 0, $ for all $A \in S$.
\item[A2] $P(\Omega) = 1.$
\item[A3] $P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup ...) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i), \break \text{for any sequence of disjunct events}.$
\end{description}

\smallskip
\textbf{Why is probability defined like this and not something else?}

Probability distributions are the elementary expressions of probabilistic thinking and
the basic building blocks of statistical models.

\bigskip

\bigskip

Distributions follow the axioms of probability and are therefore coherent and precise statements.

\begin{frame}{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Probability theory is a precise and coherent language for expressing uncertainty.
\item If we don‘t follow the rules of probability, others won‘t understand what we are saying!
\item However, we‘ve never said that probabilistic opinions have to be objective or even sensible.
\item We find it natural to have probabilistic opinions about properties that are arguably not random. This is inherently Bayesian!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
