# A brief description of the data

![](piglets.jpg)

We have piglet weights for 8 different pigs (in kg):

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("../Code/Datasets/poland.dat", sep = "\t", h = F)
```

# Estimate a pig's piglet weight

Reasoning about the mean of the underlying process that generated the data is probably the most basic and common statistical task. Typically, a t-test is applied, but, as we've discussed in Lecture 02, Null-hypothesis significance tests offer only limited information and are difficult to base decisions on. Intuitively, we 

So, instead of using a t.test, we'll create a Bayesian analogue to the t.test that will give us estimates of the parameter and probability of it being in a certain interval.

### Bayesian analogue to the t.test

Our data are real numbers

$$y_i \in \mathbb{R}, i = 1..n$$

and the t.test is based on the normal likelihood

$$y_i|\mu, \sigma^2 \sim_\text{iid} N(\mu, \sigma^2).$$

What is left is to choose priors. We'll use flat prior distributions, with the additional flexibility of setting the lowe and upper bounds:

$$\mu \sim \text{Uniform}(\mu_\text{min}, \mu_\text{max})$$

$$\sigma \sim \text{Uniform}(\sigma_\text{min}, \sigma_\text{max})$$


```{r}
eriks.bayesian.t.test <- function(y, lb = 0, ub = +Inf, 
                                  mu_min =-1e4, mu_max = 1e4) {
  
  # load or compile model, if necessary
  library(rstan)
  if (!file.exists("./Temp/bayesian_ttest.compiled")) {
    ttest_compiled <- stan_model("bayesian_ttest.stan")
    saveRDS(ttest_compiled, file = "./Temp/bayesian_ttest.compiled")
  } else {
    ttest_compiled <- readRDS("./Temp/bayesian_ttest.compiled")  
  }
  
  # prepare data
  stan_data <- list(y = y, n = length(y), mu_min = mu_min, mu_max = mu_max)
  
  # sample from model
  samples <- sampling(ttest_compiled, data = stan_data, verbose = F,
                    chains = 1, iter = 1200, warmup = 200, seed = 0, refresh = 0)
  mu <- extract(samples)$mu
  
    print(sprintf("Estimated mean and 95pct CI: %.2f (%.2f, %.2f)", mean(mu), quantile(mu, 0.025), quantile(mu, 0.975)))
  print(sprintf("The true mean is in interval (%.2f, %.2f) with probability %.3f", lb, ub, mean(mu > lb & mu < ub)))
}

```


```{r}
y <- dat[,1]
eriks.bayesian.t.test(y, lb = 2.5)

```
